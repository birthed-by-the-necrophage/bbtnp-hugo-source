_The Party infiltrates a tower and ends up in a petri dish._

<!--more-->

The party has determined that Irtep is most likely hiding out in his tower, and has accepted several competing commissions to enter the tower and retrieve Irtep and/or certain items in his possession. The investigation phase is over- time to crawl a dungeon.

But first, the party meets Gynnen, a bard who says he helped Irtep build the _Pipes of Minzoa_, and thinks that Irtep has been cursed by Osgood Flumph. Gynnen gives the party a specialized _Scroll of Greater Restoration_ and asks that they find Irtep, use the scroll to remove the curse, and bring Irtep to Gynnen so that the two can sneak out of the city and live happily ever after. The party agrees, visions of a newly vacant wizard's tower dancing in their heads.

## Stuff that happened on the way to the petri dish

* Turns out the entrance to the tower is blocked by wizard-led group from the Royal Guard. Rather than fight it out in the streets, Flynn uses a new spell to _thunder step_ him and Marvus into the second floor of the tower. While the guards are distracted by the thunderclap, Marvus throws down a rope and an invisible Grimbok (ridden Master Blaster-style by an invisible Ovek) climbs up and through a window.
* FIRST FLOOR: Skipped entirely as a result of the teleport shenanigans. This deprives the party of a fun time with an old-school puzzle trap.
* SECOND FLOOR: Marvus disturbs and kills a mummy, which has already killed a previous tower infiltrator. Both bodies are looted. The floor also contains a bunch of crates labeled as soil or water samples. One of them is marked as "contagious."
* THIRD FLOOR: Irtep's laboratory. Another dead thief is found (this one invisible) along with several "sextants" that are obviously microscopes.
* FOURTH FLOOR: Irtep's bedroom/sex den and fancy bathroom. A journal is found that details Irtep's construction of the _Minzoa sextant_, his explorations of the "inner world" he refers to as Minzoa, and his eventual descent into gambling, drunkenness, and debt.
* FIFTH FLOOR: Irtep's library, including his spell books and the  _Minzoa sextant_. Flynn doesn't get a chance to investigate the spell books before the entire party is sucked into Irtep's trapped PETRI dish (get it?) and finds itself in the afore-mentioned realm of Minzoa. It may or may not have been Ovek's fault this time.
