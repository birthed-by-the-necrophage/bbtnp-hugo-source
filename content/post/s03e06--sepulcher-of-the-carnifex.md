_An end and a beginning._

<!--more-->

10 exciting things that happened in the latest BBtN Session:

1. The party attempts to leave Irtep's tower (er, I mean _their_ tower), but find Osgood, Faisal, and Gynnen waiting outside. Osgood and Faisal both demand the _pipes of Minzoa_ and the _Minzoa Sextant_. Osgood _lightning bolts_ Faisal, who conjures a _wall of fire_ and flees. 

2. Marvus tells Osgood an extremely unbelievable and contradictory story wherin the party travels to Minzoa and somehow escapes without finding Irtep or any of the items. Gynnen joins the party as it returns to the tower to try and come up with a better plan to defraud their employers.

3. The better plan is an attempt to sneak out through a tower window with an invisible Irtep. This is interrupted by both Osgood and some of Fat Julie's goons. Eventually, the party agrees to give Osgood both the _pipes_ and _Sextant_ (including the passkey) in exchange for more money and a _wand of lightning._ 

4. During the negotiations, Flynn offends Osgood, and Osgood vows to use his influence to have Flynn shunned by the Quodeth wizarding community.

5. The party undertakes ten weeks of downtime, in which:
    
    * Most of the Irtep-related loose ends are taken care of (getting Irtep and Gynnen out of the city, returning the "dish" Michalena, paying off Irtep's debts.)
    * The items ordered from Xandor Jao arrive. Marvus names his _flame glaive_ "Throbbing Heat."
    * Flynn does some Bladesinger training and in the process forgets how to be a cleric.
    * The towers rooms are divvied up, and remodeling plans are discussed. Grimbok befriends Jolem, the ogre who lives in the attic.
    * Marvus and Grimbok become regulars at the Fight Pit, and establish themselves as a popular tag team.
       
    
6. Ready for more adventure, and now knowing the location of her prison (beneath her ruined chapel in the Temple Quarter,) the party gathers a bit of information about the Carnifex. They learn that her briefly popular cult was vanquished by a group called the Swords of the Pious, led by Azazel of the Light. Azazel and his crew descended underground after destoying the Carnifex cult's chapel, and were never seen again. Usually when people ask about this stuff it's becasuse they want to find the "Jewels of the Carnifex," rumored to still be underground in a secret under-temple.

7. The party makes it's way to said under-temple, which is found to be guarded by a monstrous, sometimes invisible, mutated spider. After attacking Grimbok a few times, the spider is driven away by an _ego whip_ from Ovek. 

8. The party turns its attention to a door engraved with the image of a skull. Lead is melted into the engraving. The door is magically sealed, but Flynn determines that melting away the lead will unseal the door. He and Marvus start in on this using a cantrip and _Throbbing Heat_, but are berated by the DM into using a plasma welder instead, which prompts Grimbok to wonder why everyone else has cooler equipment than he does. The room on the other side door turns out to be sepulcher (google it) with alcoves containing thousands of skulls.

9. Grimbok climbs a spiral staircase in the sepulcher, which leads up to impassable rubble. He decides to pry out an amulet and a scroll case. This destabilizes rubble and causes it to collapse on and destroy the stairway, which in turn causes all of the skulls to fall from the alcoves, merging into a rubble-skull avalanche.

10. The party is swept by the rubble-skull avalanche out of the sepulcher, down a stairway, and into parts unknown. Much damage is taken.
