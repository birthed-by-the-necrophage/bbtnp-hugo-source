_Session date 12/29_

Sub-Colonel Zogg has been defeated, the Eld are organizing a mass evacuation, and the island is quickly reverting to it's natural jungle conditions. The party cancels its plans for further looting, and decides to pack up and head out to fresh adventuring environs. But pack up and head out in what? The party's bubble car is no longer parked on the landing platform where they left it.

It's decided that the best course of action is to sneak back to the Vat Complex --on foot like lowly plebs-- and hope for another bubble car to steal. Sneaking is not something the party is particularly good at, unfortunately. They are spotted by Lord Vumpf (the last surviving officer on the island) as he and a large group of techs are setting portal generating machinery on the Pagoda City plaza. Lord Vumpf is old and rides around in a force-field protected hover chair.

Flynn hides behind a building while Ovek and Marvus execute an plan to charisma their way out of the situation, as follows:

* Marvus is wearing Eld ceramic plate, and thus can attempt to pose as an Eld officer escorting Grimbok and Ovek as prisoners.
* Except that Marvus doesn't speak Eldish at all, so their cover will be blown as soon as he needs to communicate with Lord Vumpf.
* But! Ovek can speak telepathically in any language, so he responds telepathically to Lord Vumpf, hoping to make it appear that it's really Marvus doing the "talking."

This doesn't work at all (maybe becauseÂ Lord Vumpf has seen Star Wars,) so Marvus switches to a hastily improvised Plan B. After a quick shock-and-awe pole arm attack relieves Lord Vumpf of many hit points, Marvus offers an ultimatum: Lord Vumpf can give the party a bubble car and in exchange the Eld can continue to peaceably evacuate, or Lord Vumpf can die at the party's hand like all of the other officers on the island.

Lord Vumpf grudgingly acquiesces, but, in an attempt to save face in front of his troops, "orders" the party to take possession of the bubble car hanger, and orders the remaining Eld on the island to leave the party alone. (He likely also begins formulating secret plans take revenge on the party as the plot of a future adventure.)
