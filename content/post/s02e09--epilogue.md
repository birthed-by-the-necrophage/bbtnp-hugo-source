_Session date 12/29_

Sub-Colonel Zogg has been defeated, the Eld are organizing a mass evacuation, and the island is quickly reverting to it's natural jungle conditions. The party cancels its plans for further looting, and decides to pack up and head out to fresh adventuring environs. But pack up and head out in what? The party's bubble car is no longer parked on the landing platform where they left it.

It's decided that the best course of action is to sneak back to the Vat Complex --on foot like lowly plebs-- and hope for another bubble car to steal. Sneaking is not something the party is particularly good at, unfortunately. They are spotted by Lord Vumpf (the last surviving officer on the island) and a large group techs and warriors setting portal generating machinery on the Pagoda City plaza. 

Flynn hides behind a building while Ovek and Marvus execute an plan to charisma their way out of the situation, as follows:

* Marvus is wearing Eld plate, and thus can attempt to pose as an Eld officer escorting Grimbok and Ovek as prisoners.
* Except that Marvus doesn't speak Eldish at all, so their cover will be blown as soon as he needs to communicate with Lord Vumpf.
* But! Ovek can speak telepathically in any language, so he responds telepathically to Lord Vumpf, hoping to make it appear that it's really Marvus doing the "talking."

It doesn't work at all, maybe becauseÂ Lord Vumpf has seen Star Wars.
