_Session date 12/29_

Sub-Colonel Zogg has been defeated, the Eld are organizing a mass evacuation, and the island is quickly reverting to it's natural jungle conditions. The party cancels its plans for further looting, and decides to pack up and head out to fresh adventuring environs. But pack up and head out in what? The party's bubble car is no longer parked on the landing platform where they left it. Damn it.

It's decided that the best course of action is to sneak (on foot like lowly plebs) back to the Vat Complex and hope for another bubble car to steal.
