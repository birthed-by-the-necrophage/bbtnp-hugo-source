## Previously On

The party has "evicted" the occupants and taken possession the _Defiance_, a wrecked spelljammer with a shattered _spelljamming helm_.

## Session Notes

### Spelljammer cleanup

* The party decides to rest for a while, and take some time investigating and cleaning up their new spelljammer. The find/learn:
    * The _spelljamming helm_ seems to have literally exploded while someone was sitting on it. Presumably Grimnar, who emerged from the disaster in his undead state.
    * His journals note that the helm had been acting up, and he might need to use the _spelljamming furnace_ as a back up, but that also it didn't matter once he took possession of the RAVAGER. 
    * The RAVAGER is what Grimnar called the astroid. He was specifically seeking it out.
    * Grimnar came from a city called the Rock of Braal, which is also on an astroid.
    * There are a bunch of charts and diagrams in the spelljammer describing star and planetary systems that the party doesn't recognize.
    * Six _bolts of beholder slaying_ are found. Unfortunately, the party has no bows.
    
* The party also examines the _spelljamming furnace_, which can be used to temporarily power a spelljammer (or maybe even the bubble car) by burning magical items. A _ram-something-or-other_ and the cursed _sword of vengeance_ are nominated candidates.
    

* While this is happening, Lucan shows up and tells party that while they were fighting Grimnar, he met a nice guy named Jon Tobart, and helped him get in to the interior of the astroid.

* The party decides that they'd better head there themselves, and pile back into the bubble car. Lucan follows, nervously, because he's afraid of the beholder lich he says lives there.

* Grimbok starts to worry that Lucan might be planning to betray them.

* The tunnel ends at a huge circular door with a cheesy message on it:

* Lucan says the Arcane are a secretive race who build stuff like this and sell it. Marvus says he'd like to meet them.

* The door slides open as soon as the party approaches. On the other side is a 300ft wide tunnel, perfectly round, running to the left and right. Also, the beholder lich! Which turns out to be a beholder zombie. There are three of them. 

### BEHOLDER ZOMBIE BATTLE

* Lucan flees in terror.

* Flynn uses the _fire elemental egg_, which he's been carrying around since like level three because the party doesn't use expendable items.

* Ovek summons an air Elemental.

* It's no fun for the DM when summoned creatures soak up all the cool monster attacks.

* Flynn and Marvus both get paralyzed by beholder rays.

* Grimbok lobs fireballs.

* "Lighting Bolt" Flynn (his new name) hits all three zombies with a perfectly aligned lighting bolt attack, killing one.	

* Marvus kills the other two in the next round.

### Into the asteroid, finally

* Into the astroid, turning left, and travel until reaching a branching passage. Ovek's Air Elemental follows the bubble car.

* Check out the branch to the right, where a stone hits the bubble car and temporarily changes part of it to stone. It's a huge area lined with scrub land and canyons inhabited by hill giant goat herders.

* Check out the branch to left, which leads into what appears to be interior of one of the obelisks. The obelisk is capped by transparent crystal but otherwise empty.

* Back to the main tunnel and travel to the next branch. To the left is presumably another obelisk. The right leads to another huge room. This one is empty except for huge rocks (much larger than the ricks in the other room) bouncing back and forth breakout-style.
