*Session Date: 09/05/2017*

The party begins this session on the north shore of what is conclusively revealed to be an island, and end it back in the Corpselvator, ascending to the mysteries Fourth Floor. Along the way, they:

* Get ambushed at the fueling station (Area 17), and encounter a new monster: brutish giants with metal skullcaps, who attack (and damage) the bubble car! Ovek mind controls one into attacking the accompanying Eld warriors instead. Also present at the ambush is the Eldish psychonaut Mindseer Vixxel. He doesn't survive.

* Are followed into the mist by another bubble car. A bubble car dogfight ensures, and the Eld pilot is driven away by the party's superior firepower (Flynn's *shatter* spell.) The party's bubble car takes more damage and expends a lot of fuel on *fireballs*.

*

* Notice that the environment of the island seems to be changing. It's notably warmer, and small plants are sprouting at various points in the landscape.

* Make a dramatic enterence and park the bubble car on the third floor of the floating god-torture facility, where work to repair the party's carnage is already underway. Marvus and Grimbok make quick work of Uber-Lieutenant Mozz and his plasma-torch-weilding techs, and the party procedes to the fourth floor. Hopefully the bubble car will still be there when they get back...
