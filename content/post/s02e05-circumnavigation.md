*Session Date: 08/05/2017*

This session begins on the north shore of what is conclusively revealed to be an island, and ends back in the Corpselvator, ascending to the mysterious Fourth Floor. Along the way some stuff happens, including:
<!--more-->

* The party is ambushed at the fueling station (Area 17), and encounter a new monster: brutish giants with metal skullcaps, who attack (and damage) Bubbly! Ovek mind controls one of the giants into attacking the accompanying Eld warriors instead. Also present at the ambush is the Eldish psychonaut Mindseer Vixxel, who doesn't survive.

* The party is followed into the mist by another bubble car. A dogfight ensues, and the Eld pilot is driven away by Bubbly's enhanced firepower (Flynn's *shatter* spell.) Bubbly also takes some damage, and expends some extra fuel on *fireballs*.

*

* The party notices that the environment of the island seems to be changing. It's notably warmer, and small plants are sprouting at various points in the landscape.

* The party becomes mildly concerned about the way the *Wand of Cure Wounds* is attempting to impose lawfulness on Flynn every time it's used.

* The party makes a dramatic vehicular entrance and parks Bubbly on the third floor of the floating god-torture facility (Area 3), where work to repair the party's carnage is already underway. Marvus and Grimbok make quick work of Uber-Lieutenant Mozz and his plasma-torch-weilding techs, and the party procedes to the Fourth Floor. Hopefully Bubbly will still be there when they get back...
