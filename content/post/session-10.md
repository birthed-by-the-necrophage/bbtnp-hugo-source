*Fresh off their successful home invasion of the* EMERALD ENCHANTER*, intrepid Thulian adventurers Flynn the Fortunate, Marvus the Wolf, and Ovek the Tall, along with their loyal half-beast henchman Grimbok, head into the* JUNGLE OF BURA *for some routine archaeological looting. Unfortunately, the targeted structure --ruins of the elvish* LAPIS OBSERVATORY*-- is is found to be currently occupied by the* ELD*, and the party is sucked into an* INTERDIMENSIONAL RIFT *(It was Ovek’s fault.)*

## Now

The party finds itself on a cliff overlooking a gray ocean beneath a sunless gray sky.  The ground is flat and coated with a coarse salt-like material. 300 foot-high worms dominate the view in most directions. It’s much colder than the jungle. Ovek and Flynn have each been switched with an alternate Ovek and Flynn from a parallel reality, but the alternates are close enough to the originals that no one is bothered.

The group begins to explore:

*Dark scribbles are coastline, railroad tracks lines are trails, wormy things are big wormy things. Each hex is .5 miles.*

### Area 15

Arrival area, cliffs.

### Area 8

Paralyzed Eld stuck in an amber-filled bathtub, holding a wand. Ovek attempts to communicate telepathically and gets a hostile response. Flynn takes a Wand of Cure Wounds.

### Area 17

An island with boat docks. Viewed but not visited.

### Area 9

Peasant-henge. Spells cast inside the henge will have their effects doubled.

### Area 10

Pagoda city. Six streets of identical buildings (found to be empty facades) radiate from a central tower with a single entrance. The party makes two excursions into the tower. 

On the first, they find themselves locked in an “entrance trap” room and escape by means of Flynn’s *knock* spell. 14 Eldish warriors are waiting on the other side of the door, but are dispatched with the help of Ovek’s new area effect blast power. Shortly later, more doors auto-lock, and Marvus is trapped in a hallway. After plasma-torching the hallway door open, the party retreats to take a short rest.

On the second excursion, it’s found that every interior door seems to be internally barred. The party can only advance by means of *knock* or plasma torch, both of which are soon exhausted. Several Eldish items are grabbed from a supply locker before another retreat, and Flynn is struck with a strange lawful urge to tidy the room. 

### Area 11

A complex consisting of a bunker-like building, three silos, and a tower with a bubble car parked on the roof. 

Marvus immediately suggests stealing the bubble car. A guard on the tower roof spots the party as they begin their approach...
