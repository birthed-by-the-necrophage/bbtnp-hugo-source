## Previously On

Still in space, the party has discovered the secret entrance to the interior of an astroid/ancient beholder artifact.

## Session Notes

* The party has traveled in the bubble car through the "entrance crevice" canyon and into a large round tunnel. Gravity pulls equally on all sides to the tunnel, making it hard to determine curves and descent angles.

* The <s>spotting</s> perceiving of large dragon-like shapes prompts the party to land the bubble car and prepare for a possible combat encounter. One of the dragon-like shapes responds by blasting the party and the bubble car with a TOTALLY UNPROVOKED breath weapon attack. This takes the already damaged bubble car back down to 0 HP.

* The dragon-like shapes are void dragons: chaotic neutral space dragons with twinkling star-scape scales. There are two of them.

* Marvus flys up to return the attack, and does like 20 attacks and 30,000 damage in one round. Grimbok, weirdly, lobs some _magic missiles_ at the same dragon, nearly killing her. But before anyone else in the party gets to do anything, the other dragon cancels the combat encounter and turns it into a role-playing encounter.

* You see, the dragon explains, he and his sister didn't realize the party was so powerful before they attacked, and they don't actually want to engage in combat that they might not win. He proposes that instead of attacking again, the party should HEAL his sister, and in exchange, he won't use his breath weapon to destroy the bubble car beyond repair. After that, the dragons and the party can be friends.

* The party is extremely suspicious of this proposal at first, but agrees to it after lengthy negotiation. 

* By talking to the dragons, the party learns some stuff:
    * The dragons's names are Lucan and Cassia, and they are very young by void dragon standards, almost still children.
    * They have a lair in the astroid, which drifts through the void of space and sometimes ends up in temporary orbit around a planet.
    * The party is not allowed in the lair, but the dragons are willing to trade magic items. 
    * Spelljammers are ships that travel through space using a magic item called a _spelljamming helm_.
    * There's a crashed spelljammer further up the tunnel that probably has a _spelljamming helm_ in it. Unfortunately, it's haunted by a spectre. Lucan and Cassia are afraid of it.
    * Farther still up the tunnel is the entrance to the lair of a beholder lich.
    * Beholders with dead central eyes are the only beholders who can cast wizard spells
    
* The party is alarmed to hear about the beholder lich lair, which is something Jon Tobart never mentioned. They decide that they probably don't want to check it out (perhaps becasue they've become pampered, wealthy, tower-owning city-dwellers.) Instead, they plan to stay in the kiddie pool and just loot the crashed spelljammer, maybe using the _spelljamming helm_ to get back home.

* Ok, but what's going on with Jon Tobart, and the "powerful weapon that threatens the all of Thule and even the entire world"? And what about the Greshtharx fleet? Maybe we'll find out next time!
