## Session Notes

* Party assesses the situation, decides that each obelisk and corresponding room represent a specific beholder eye power.

* The tunnels on the other side of the rooms must lead to the equivalent of the central eye. Party decides to head straight there and not bother with the individual rooms.

* THe decide to travl through the hill giant goat-herder room. Travel is not in a straigh line because the bubble car can't rise higher then 100 ft (30.48 meters) above the "walls" of the room.

* Pass a group of stone giants fighter medusas along the way. Decide no to get involved.

* See a big suit of metal armor posistioned by the exit tunnel.

* Arrive at the central chamber. It's a big sphere and has clouds. There's a decahedron shaped crystal at the top. The surface is covered by dead vegitation and giant panels of some sort.

* Jon Tobart is spotted standing atop the crystal, monologues. He's wearing a suit of armor like the one the party saw earlier, Krang-stye, except that an armor panel covers his face. After his monologue he disappears to the interior of the crystal.

* Jon Tobart does something that activates the room. The crystal starts moving toward the center of the room, the panels start rising toward it.

* The party parks the bubble car on one of the panels and rides along with it for a bit, and then fly (Marvus carrying Flynn and Grimbok) or teleport (Grimbok) the rest of the way to they crystal.  

* When crystal reaches the center of the sphere, lasers shoot from the eye-stalk tunnels, through the planels, and into the crystal. The panels join together to form a sphere around the crystal. 

* The parry enters the crystal through a tunnel at one of the tips. The tunnel leads to a smaller interior decahedron. Jon Tobart is here in his Krang-suit.

* Battle!
