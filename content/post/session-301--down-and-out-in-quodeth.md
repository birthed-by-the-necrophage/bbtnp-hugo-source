_In which the Party arrives in Quodeth on their  loot-laden galley with three goals: sell stuff, buy stuff, and release a chaos god._

## Downtime

The party secures a space at the "good docks" in the Canal Quarter, and quickly gets going on some non-adventuring activities:

* Marvus carouses all over town to make some contacts, and then works on flooding Qudoeth with vast amounts of loot (which includes arming the Seven Knives thieves guild with a cache of Eldish melee weapon.)
* Ovek and Flynn research the magimechanical workings of the bubble car, and end up creating a _repair bubblecar_ spell.
* Next, the party works together to find magic items for sale in the city. The initial results are very underwhelming, but eventually a deal is struck with Xhonder Jao (curio seller and Marvus's new contact) on an order of very specific items: A _flame-glaive_ for Marvus, a _wand of fireballs_ for Ovek, a _mantle of spell resistance_ (probably) for Flynn, and ..._something_... for Grimbok.
* RETCON ALERT: The order has been placed and paid, but the items haven't arrived yet.
* All said, these activities took 6 weeks of game time, and by the end the Party is fairly well established in Quodeth as weirdos who live on a boat.

## The Search for Itrep

With the business transactions and research wrapped up, the party begins it's quest to free The Carnifex from her prison beneath Quodeth.

This means talking to the wizard Itrep, who (according to The Carnifex-splinter on the Eld island,) knows where exactly the prison is. Turns out Itrep is missing, though, and information on his whereabouts must be gathered.
