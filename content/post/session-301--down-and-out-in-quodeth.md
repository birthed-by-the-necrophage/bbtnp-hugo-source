_In which the Party arrives in Quodeth (City of Thieves, on their  loot-laden galley with three goals: sell stuff, buy stuff, and release a chaos god._

<!--more-->

## Downtime

The party secures a space at the "good docks" in the Canal Quarter, and quickly gets going on some non-adventuring activities:

* Marvus carouses all over town to make some contacts: Xhonder Jao the curio seller and Nadar the Seven Knives Lieutenant. He then works on flooding Qudoeth with vast amounts of loot (which includes arming the Seven Knives thieves guild with a cache of Eldish melee weapon.)
* Ovek and Flynn research the magimechanical workings of the bubble car, and end up creating a _repair bubblecar_ spell.
* Next, the party works together to find magic items for sale in the city. The initial results are very underwhelming, but eventually a deal is struck with Xhonder Jao on an order of very specific items: A _flame-glaive_ for Marvus, a _wand of fireballs_ for Ovek, a _mantle of spell resistance_ (probably) for Flynn, and ..._something_... for Grimbok.
* RETCON ALERT: The order has been placed and paid, but the items haven't arrived yet.
* All said, these activities took 6 weeks of game time, and by the end the Party is fairly well established in Quodeth as weirdos who live on a boat.

## The Search for Itrep

With the business transactions and research wrapped up, the party begins it's quest to free The Carnifex from her prison beneath Quodeth.

This means talking to the wizard Itrep, who (according to The Carnifex-splinter on the Eld island,) knows where exactly the prison is. Turns out Itrep is missing, though, and information on his whereabouts must be gathered. This leads to a series of encounters with several of Itrep's associates, each of home has information to give and want something in return:

* Fat Julie, halfling proprietor of the Fight Pit, offers the party 5000 gp to track down Itrep an relieve him of 15,000 gp (the amount Irtep owes Julie in gampling debts)
* Faisal Dhaken, an evil looking turbaned wizard, offers the party 5,000 gp and several magic items to enter Itrep's tower and retrieve the _pipes of Minzoa_ 
* Osgood Flumph, another wizard, offers the party 5,000 gp and several magic items to enter Itrep's tower and retrieve the _Minzoa  Sextant._ He also reveals the solution to a puzzle-trap he helped build on the first floor of the tower. Negotiations are handled by Flynn and Ovek while Marvus and Grimbok (having failed saves) flee in terror from the Wizard's Familiar tavern, which only admits arcane spell casters.
* Michalena, Irtep's former girlfriend, reveals the password to the towers's ground floor entrance, in exchange for 500 gp and a promise to retrieve a crystal dish that she liked. Negotiations are handled solely by Marvus, who has to win a duel to join the racist (humans only) Pride of Waymarch fighter's club to gain access to Michalena.

The Party accepts all the offers.
