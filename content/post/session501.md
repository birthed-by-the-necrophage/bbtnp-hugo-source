The party has been deeded Tobart Tower as payment for services rendered to Jon Tobart (a recently deceased space beholder.)

## Session Notes

* Tobart tower is a six story octogonal structure with no visible windows or doors. On their first visit, the party was shown in through a secret door on the ground level, but this time they start from the roof.

* The _teleportoscope_ and it's linked _teleportation circle_ are still on the roof \(R), which is a great place to park the bubble car.

* The party descends a stairway to level six (6) of the tower, which contains:
    * A dining room, which the party has previously seen.
    * A kitchen, which contains evidence that the party had been served human flesh on their first visit to the tower.
    * A ten foot circular hole in the floor, leading to level five.
    * <p>No other exits are seen, though on their previous visit, the party was lead up a hidden staircase and through a secret door in the dining room wall.</p>
    
* Ovek sets a _nomadic anchor_ in the kitchen.
        
* The hole in the floor would be a very convenient passageway for a beholder, but has usability issues for non-flying bipedal creatures. Marvus pokes his head though to get a look at the next floor down.

* Wait, sorry, Marvus does _not_ "poke his head through," he positions himself to gain line of site without exposing any part of himself to whatever lies below. 

* WHAT LIES BELOW: a single large room inhabited by three flesh golems (5). The golems are standing around a ten foot wide cylinder. Three large handles extend from the cylinder like spokes of a ship's wheel laid on its side.

* Grimbok goes down and attempts to parley. The parley fails.

### FLESH GOLEM BATTLE!

* Grimbok and Marvus face the golems head on, while Flynn and Ovek lob LOS attacks through the hole.

* Grimbok _fireballs_, and learns that flesh golems react very poorly to fire. Ovek piles on the fire with _combustion_.

* Lightning Bolt Flynn _lighting bolts_ a golem, which doesn't work as well as the _fireball_. Marvus adds "flesh golems being healed by lightning" to his new collection of scents. 

* Marvus cleaves and action surges his way to 122 damage in a single round, taking out two of the golems.

* Grimbok and Ovek both heal Marvus. Weird.

* After the battle, the cylinder and wheel are investigated investigated. The handles are numbered, and there is a mark on the floor. 

* The cylinder is the entrance to a 20 foot wide circular shaft. Marvus looks down and is surprised to learn that he still doesn't have darkvision. Grimbok can see that it descends about 60 feet, ending above what appears to be a huge pile of treasure(B):

* This looks to the party like an obvious trap, and Marvus and Grimbok fly down to get a slightly closer look. Grimbok _detects magic_, and the treasure pile radiates transmutation. Grimbok also spots some circular indentations in the wall of the shaft, the same size as the shaft's entrance.

* Next, the wheel is investigated. With great effort, the wheel can be rotated&mdash;the combined might of Grimbok and Marvus can barely manage it.  It becomes apparent that rotating the wheel was probably a tasked assigned to the three flesh golems stationed in the room.

* Rotating the wheel causes the shaft to rotate, and when a handle is positioned over the mark on the floor, the circular indentations slide away to reveal exits that lead to different levels of the tower. There are three positions, one for each handle. Each position opens different exits. 

* The exits only remain open while the wheel is physically held in the required position. When released, the wheel spins back to its default position, closing all exits. This means that (until other means are devised,) Grimbok and Marvus will need to stay above and man the wheel while Ovek and/or Flynn explore the lower levels.   

* Ovek manifests _essence of air_ to fly down and poke his head into the tunnel exits while Marvus and Grimbok move the wheel to each of the three positions. Ovek reports:
    * A flesh golem lab (floor 2, wheel setting 1)
    * A room with demon summoning symbols inscribed on the floor and walls (floor 2, wheel setting 2)
    * A room that Ovek seems to have forgotten to look at (floor 4, wheel setting 2)
    * <p>A room with a picture window overlooking an alien landscape (floor 1, wheel setting 3)</p>

* Party decides to take a break before investigating further. Flynn wants to maybe buy some scrolls.
