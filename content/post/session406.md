## Session Notes

* Eyes of the asteroid function as 300ft wide beholder rays, no dex save.

* Flynn used the disintegration ray to destroy the beholder fleet.

* The astroid takes control of Flynn. He prepares to find and destroy Quodeth, as revenge for not being invited to join the wizard council. Grimbok knocks him out of it with a cantrip, granting a new save. Grimbok also generously provides a +5 bonus. Flynn makes it.

* Flynn realizes that if he withdraws from controlling the astroid, it will revert to it's unarmed state, and the party lacks the knowledge/means to reactivate it. Maybe Jon Tobart left his research on the matter in his tower?

* Flynn pilots the astroid back to the greater Quodeth area. It seems to be okay operating within a planetary atmosphere and gravitational field. The trip takes three days, and party gets a view of their planet's continents on the way.

* Also on the way, the party discusses the best place to land the astroid. The mountains north of Quodeth are considered, but the the ocean a bit south of Quodeth is eventually settled on.

* But first, the party wants to blow something up with their doomsday weapon. Marvus reaches far back into campaign setting lore and suggests the sentient glacier that is slowly engulfing Thule, but then realizes that it's too far away from Quodeth and he probably doesn't actually know about it.

* So maybe that castle on the island below Quodeth? Or maybe the artifact was actually on to something, and they should destroy the Quodeth Wizard Council for snubbing Flynn.

* Grimbok prays to Carnifex for advice on the matter, and surprisingly gets a response: a weapon this powerful should not be used capriciously, but should be hidden away until the proper time.

* Sure, ok, but the party decides that first they should at least destroy Osgood Flumph's tower. Osgood Flumph is the reason for the Wizard Council snub, after all, and is also responsible for the gambling addiction curse that destroyed Irtrep's life and drove him into microscopic hiding. And anyway, destroying a building as revenge is _demonstratedly_ the sort of thing the Carnifex would do (see [Session 309: Epilogue II](/2019/04/session-309-epilogue-ii/)).

* Flynn sets course for a Quodeth flyover, and the deed is accomplished with four blasts from the _disintegration ray_. Flumph Tower and it's grounds are reduced to a fine dust. The neighborhoods around Flumph Tower are treated to generous applications of the _charm ray_, with hope that this will cause any witnesses to have a favorable impression of the building-destroying UFO.

* The party decides they'd better head out when a wizard in Quodeth tries (but fails) to _scry_ them.

* The asteroid is landed in the ocean, positioned with the dome facing up and obelisks pointing outward. The water level is just high enough so that the astroid can rest on the ocean floor without submerging the obelisks or the entrance crevice. [Note: the interior of the astroid has, so far, retained its weird internal gravitational schemes, but the surface now functions under normal planetary gravity.]

* Flynn relinquishes control of the astroid and it reverts to it's unarmed status- the lasers stop as the platforms, the central crystal, and the eye crystals all return to their previous positions.

* Now the party has to figure out how to get themselves and their _spelljaming furnace_ back to Quodeth. It can in theory be used to power the bubble car, but there isn't a good way to secure it to the exterior, and it gets too hot to be in the passenger area.

* The party decides to use the _furnace_ to power the _Defiance_, despite the vessel's  extremely poor condition. The _furnace_ is activated by burning the _Sword of Vengeance_, with Flynn acting as the spelljammer. Going from the asteroid to the _Defiance_ is a devestating letdown, and Flynn vows that he will someday learn the secret to activating the astroid.

* (For some reason, flying the bubble car under its own power, with the _furnace_ in the passenger area but safely powered down, never came up. Also, why is the party carrying around a weapon that no one is using and that they know to be cursed? Weird.)

* The trip back to Quedeth is short but harrowing, with pieces of the _Defiance_ falling off along the way. At Marvus' suggestion, the party lands directly atop the remains of Flumph Tower, a blatant (but vague) statement connecting the party to the astroid's visit the night before.

* The _Defiance_ is designed for zero g and has no landing capability even if it wasn't a wreck. It falls to its side and takes even more damage.

* The Party (minus Ovek) heads directly to Tobart Tower to check out their new real estate acquisition. Ovek drives the bubble car back to Irtep Tower to park it and check in with the butler. All is well at Irtep Tower, but it doesn't actually have aplace to park a bubble car. He instead parks on the roof of Tobart Tower, meeting up with the rest of the party.

Thus ends the party's (first?) adventure in space.
