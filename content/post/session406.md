## Session Notes

* Eyes of the asteroid function as 300ft wide beholder rays, no dex save.

* Flynn used the disintegration ray to destroy the beholder fleet.

* The astroid takes control of Flynn. He prepares to find and destroy Quodeth, as revenge for not being invited to join the wizard council. Grimbok knocks him out of it with a cantrip, granting a new save. Grimbok also generously provides a +5 bonus. Flynn makes it. 

* Flynn realizes that if he withdraws from controlling the astroid, it will revert to it's unarmed state, and the party lacks the knowledge/means to reactivate it. Maybe Jon Tobart left his research on the matter in his tower?

* Flynn pilots the astroid back to the greater Quodeth area. It seems to be okay operating within a planetary atmosphere and gravitational field. The trip takes three days, and party gets a view of their planet's continents on the way. 

* Also on the way, the party discusses the best place to land the astroid. The mountains north of Quodeth are considered, but the the ocean a bit south of Quodeth is eventually settled on.

* But first, the party wants to blow something up with their doomsday weapon. Marvus reaches far back into campaign setting lore and suggests the sentient glacier that is slowly engulfing Thule, but then realizes that it's too far away from Quodeth and he probably doesn't actually know about it. 

* So maybe that castle on the island below Quodeth? Or maybe the artifact was actually on to something, and they should destroy the Quodeth Wizard Council for snubbing Flynn.

* Grimbok prays to Carnifex for advice on the matter, and surprisingly gets a response: a weapon this powerful should not be used capriciously, but should be hidden away until the proper time. 

* The party decides that first they should at least destroy Osgood Flumph's tower. Osgood Flumph is the reason for the Wizard Council snub, after all, and is also responsible for the gambling addiction curse that destroyed Irtrep's life and drove him into microscopic hiding. And anyway, revenge-building-destruction is _demonstratedly_ the sort of thing the Carnifex would do. 

* Flynn sets course for a Quodeth flyover, and the deed is accomplished with four blasts from the _disintegration ray_. Flumph Tower and it's grounds are reduced to a fine dust, but the party doesn't know for sure if Osgood Flumph was actually home at the time. The neighborhoods around Flumph Tower  are treated to generous applications of the _charm ray_, with hope that this will cause any witnesses to have a favorable impression of the building-destroying UFO. 

* The asteroid is landed in the ocean, positioned with the dome facing up and obelisks pointing outward. The water level is just high enough so that the astroid can rest on the ocean floor without submerging the obelisks or the entrance crevice. [Note: the interior of the astroid has, so far, retained its weird internal gravitational schemes, but the surface of the now functions under normal planetary gravity.]




## Foes Vanquished
