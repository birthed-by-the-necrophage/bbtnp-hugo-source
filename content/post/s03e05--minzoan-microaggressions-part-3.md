_Session date: 07/28/2018, Dave's house_

_A goal is achieved._

<!--more-->

Picking up the action right where it left off, Ovek approaches Irtep's cabin while the rest of the party battles its way up the hill. Ovek finds the cabin door to be locked, and _knocks_ it open. 

Meanwhile, it's remembered that Flynn carries a _restoration_ scroll that can remove the curse allegedly placed on Irtep by Osgood. After Flynn resolves some confusion about who can use a scroll and how to do it, Grimbok rushes past the tardigrades and giant sporozoans to deliver the scroll to Ovek. 

Grimbok arrives at the cabin just in time for him and Ovek to take an _ice storm_ from Elzenette. Ovek goes down. Marvus also heads for the cabin, and Elzenette isn't able to launch another spell before meeting a grisly end.

With Elzenette dead, Marvus is able to convince Irtep to cast the scroll on himself. Doing so immediately _restores_ his mental state, and Irtep reflects with horror on his actions over the last several months. He dismisses the monsters and returns with the party to his tower. 

While Irtep and the party recover from their Minzoan odyssey, Marvus leads a lengthy negotiation. The following is eventually agreed to:

* Irtep will give the party his tower, the _pipes of Minzoa_, the _Minzoa Sextant_, and information about the Carnifex.

* In return, the party takes on all responsibility for Irtep's debt (20,000gp,) and will help Irtep safely leave the city with Gynnen to live happily ever after.

Now the party just needs to decide if they're going to honor the other four agreements they made before entering the tower...
