_Session date: 05/05/2018, Kevin's house_

_The party arrives in Minzoa and fights some monsters._

The party finds itself shrunk down to microscopic size and trapped in Itrep's petri dish, a place Irtrep's journal referred to an Minzoa. Minzoa is wet and very humid. The ground is spongy, uneven, and covered by fungi. A lake is seen in the distance. 

Before any further investigations can be made, the party is attacked by hideous protozoan monstrosities! (A Giant Hydrozoa)

Based on notes that are both very detailed and woefully incomplete, the battle went down something like this:

1\. Flynn leads off with a _lightning bolt_

2\. Ovek psionics up a a _wall of ice_ to keep several of the Protozoic Orbs away from the party

3\. Marvus and Grimbok attack the Giant Hydrozoa, but end up paralyzed and grappled by it's tentacles

4\. Marvus also gets stuck to one of the Protozoic Orbs

5\. Flynn _thundersteps_

6\. Marvus and Grimbok escape their grapples and overcome their paralysis, and presumably attack some more

7\. Ovek kills ...something... with a _distracting figment_

8\. Marvus and Grimbok kill some Protozoic Orbs

9\. Ovek kills a Protozoic Orb with _mind thrust_

10\. Flynn fails to climb a hill

11\. Marvus and Grimbok kill a Protozoic Orb that is eating the Giant Hydrozoa (which has also apparently died at some point)

12\. The remaining Protozoic Orbs, unable to penetrate the _wall of ice_, flee

\## Foes Vanquished
