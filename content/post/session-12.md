_Session Date: 6/4/2017_

Stuff that happened in Session 12:

The party figures out the basics of bubble car operation and flee the scene of the Session 11's near-TPK, heading northwest into the mists off the shore of thier original arival point (15.) 

The bubble car seems to have a maximum altitude of about 100ft from the ground, and Flynn notices that both the bubble car and plasma welder seem to be "powered" by the same mysterious liquid. When the plasma torch ran out of liquid, it stopped working. The bubble car presumably worked the same way.

After spending a long rest in the mist, healing and recaauterating in bubble car luxury, it's time for some more exploration. 

Travel northwest into the mist over the water, long rest 
Re-appear from the north, near the amber bathtub
Land at dock island, kill guards
Investigate skiffs, note similarities to bubble car, find naval maps of island
Investigate galley, Thulian, sings of a struggle
Fuel tank- refill plasma welder and bubble car
Travel east and south along the coast
Find the monument, land, kill Mivixx
Ridiculous parley with the bone grinders
Level 2, soul cube specters. Flynn defeats with his flaming sword
Eld with the hat. Flynn kills, Ovek tries the hat.
Level 3, bone grinder battle, secret room
