*Session Date: 6/4/2017*

The party scrambles to learn the basics of bubble car operation, fleeing the scene of Session 11's near-TPK and heading northwest into the mists (off the shore of Area 15.)

The bubble car seems to have a maximum altitude of about 100ft, and Flynn notices that both the bubble car and plasma welder seem to be "powered" by the same mysterious liquid. When the plasma torch ran out of liquid, it stopped working. The bubble car presumably works the same way.

After spending a long rest spent hovering in the mist, it's time for some more exploration. Strangely, the party emerges from the mist some two and a half miles east of where they entered (above Area 8.) Ovek posits that they must have drifted while hovering. Nobody makes much of it, and the group decides to fly over to the previously inaccessible island (Area 17) and check it out.

## Area 17

This island contains:

* Two Eld guards, wich serve as test subjects for the bubble car's *fireball* ability. Turns out *fireballs* use a lot of fuel.

* A utility building with nothing interesting inside.

* A large fuel storage tank, which the party uses to refill both the bubble car and the plasma torch.

* A dock with two small metal skiffs of a design that looks similar to the bubble car, and with similar controls. One of the skiffs has a nautical chart showing safe approach routes for an island about five miles wide.

* Also docked is a galley that appears to be of standard Thulean make and design. It's empty, but shows signs that a bloody struggle took place on its deck.

Next, the party travels further east along the coast, which soon curves to the south, and the party follows a long, empty black-sand beach (Areas 1 - 2) until they see a strange sight to the west (Area 3), a floating, oddly shaped structure:
