## Previously On

After being _teloportoscoped_ into space and blasted by a strange space going vessel, the bubble car has crashed on a weird astroid (Ovek's fault.)

## Session Notes
 
* Everyone survives the bubble car crash intact, becasue of _feather fall_ rings or whatever. The bubble car itself is reduced to 0 HP, though. 

* The vessel (now known to be a beholder spaceship) descends, but its occupants speak through an external speaker system instead of attacking the exposed party. 

* Key take-aways from the ensuing parlay:
	* The beholders in this ship represent the Greshtharx beholder nation, which is the only true beholder nation, and all non-Greshtharx beholders are hideous aberrations fit only for destruction.
    * Shazogrox (Jon Tobart) is a hunted rebel. His central eye was destroyed as a punishment.
    * The party is too insignificant for the beholders to bother destroying. Instead, the party is hereby ordered to apprehend Shazogrox and deliver him to the Greshtharx.
    * The beholders claim to not know what the astroid is, but they seem afraid of it.
    * <p>The rest of the Greshtharx fleet will arrive soon, so the party better get to it.</p>

* After the beholder ship leaves, the party turns its attention to the immediate situation. They learned from Jon Tobart that the physics of space mean that they only have about 20 minutes of breathable air on the surface of the astroid. Luckily, it is house-ruled that the interior of Flynn's _Leomund's Tiny Hut_ also provides a breathable atmosphere.

* Inside the _Hut_, Ovek and Flynn work on a _repair bubble car_ spell (this takes 8 hours divided by the number of spellcasters,) while Marvus the uses his new cloud giant abilities to take a short recon flight. He spots some huge obelisks sticking up over the horizon of the astroid in every direction, but nothing else of interest.

* And then... earth elementals attack! The elementals can move through the ground and bypass the wall of the _Hut_. The ensuing battle lets the party try out some of its new abilities:
    * Marvus returns from his recon flight and dive bombs, and then does a bunch of cleaving.
    * The new Grimbok throws around _maddening hexes_ and _lightning bolts_.
    * Ovek summons his own elemental: of the fire variety, with a worryingly large number of hitpoints.
    * <p>Flynn just _lightning bolts_, which I guess isn't new. </p>
 
* After the battle and some resting, the party piles back in to a partially repaired bubble car to search for the "entrance crevice" that Jon Tobart told them about. They circumnavigate the astroid in two directions, and make some discoveries:
    * The circumference of the astroid is about 10 miles
    * There is a huge (1 mile wide) brass dome directly opposite the bubble car crash site on the "front" of the astroid.
    * <p>The "left" and "right" sides of the astroid each have a line of 5 evenly spaced obelisks. The obelisks are about 1500 feet tall and 300 feet wide.</p>

* Eventually, the entrance crevice is found near one of the obelisks, in the form of a canyon that eventually becomes a tunnel. Nothing to do now but see what's down there.
