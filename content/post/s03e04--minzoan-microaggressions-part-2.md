After spending an entire session on one minor battle (area 1), the party decides to get down to business and starts exploring/looking for Irtep. Finding Irtep is now more important than it already was- the party doesn't know of any other way to leave Minzoa and return to full size.

Ovek climbs a hill and spots a large lake to the north. The party heads in that direction and finds an abandoned camp site (area 2), where they are attacked by a protozoan orb. The orb is quickly punctured/slashed/_mind-thrusted_/_fire-bolted_/punctured/punctured to death.  After the battle, Flynn builds a makeshift boat out of a hollowed-out mushroom cap, and the party sets off in the direction of the closest island.

Enroute, the party is attacked by giant sporozoans (area 3), who manage to poison Flynn before being defeated. 

## Enter Elzenette

Upon reaching the island (area 4), Ovek climbs another hill, but is distracted by meeting ELZENETTE and forgets to do any spotting. 

Elzenette is a higher-level-than-the-party wizard and sole survivor of an earlier expedition to find Irtep. He _flys_ down the hill and quickly offers to team up with the party, by which he means that the party can become his new group of lackeys. When the party objects, he attempts to cast _suggestion_ on Ovek, but is successfully _counterspelled_ by Flynn. Elzenette soon finds himself out of actions and directly in Marvus' threatened area. 

Realizing that he has vastly underestimated the party's abilities, Elzenette becomes friendly and attempts, poorly, to be ingratiating. He offers to tell the party where Irtep is in exchange for a ride there on the mushroom-cap boat. After some tense negotiation led by Marvus, party reluctantly agrees, and the group again sets off.

While at sea (area 5), the party encounters a group of what appear to by Red Fury thieves guild members, adrift on a makeshift raft and clearly having a rough time. They ask for help, but are rebuffed by Marvus and ignored by the rest of the party.

Finally, the party arrives at an island (area 6) where Irtep has built a small cabin at the top of a steep hill. 

## The Battle of Irtep's Hill

Irtep emerges from the cabin, and tells the party, in no uncertain terms, to go away. He isn't looking very healthy, but punctuates his demand by using the _pipes of Minzoa_ to summon a group of tardigrades and sporazoans to defend the hill.

The party is undeterred, and springs into action. Ovek summons an _ice barrier_ while Marvus and Grimbok jump into melee. 

Elzenette, meanwhile, _flys_ directly OVER the battle, straight toward Irtep. He announces that he has a message from Michalena, that the party is here to kill Irtep, and that Irtep should immediately transfer the two of them out of Minzoa without the party. 

Cursing this sudden but inevitable betrayal, Flynn attempts to trap Elzenette in a _web_. Elzenette escapes with a _misty step_, and soon reaches the cabin. Ovek _bestial forms_ some wings and is close behind, but arrives at the top of the hill just in time for Elzenette and Irtep to enter the cabin and shut the door.
